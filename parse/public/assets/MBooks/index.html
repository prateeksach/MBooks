		MBooks is a craigslist for books at the University of Michigan. More specifically, MBooks is a web app that allows anyone to search for books being sold by University of Michigan students/alumni. We found that students currently use Facebook groups to post buy and sell requests but the process is cumbersome and rarely effective. Therefore, we created a user friendly website where one can only post books on sale and buyers can easily search by book name, course name or even the ISBN for quick and easy access. 

		<br /><br />

		With all the overhead of current textbook exchange methods such as Facebook groups, we feel that MBooks offers a simple, convenient alternative to finding the books you need and getting rid of the ones you don't. The website can be accessed here: <a href="http://mbooks.parseapp.com" target="_blank">http://mbooks.parseapp.com</a>.
